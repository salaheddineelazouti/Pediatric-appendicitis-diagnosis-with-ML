                        This web application was developed to assist pediatricians and emergency physicians in diagnosing appendicitis in children. 
                        It uses machine learning models trained on clinical data to provide prediction probabilities based on symptoms, 
                        clinical examination findings, and laboratory test results.

                    <p class="card-text">
                        The application is trained on the Regensburg Pediatric Appendicitis Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository, 
                        which includes clinical features, laboratory results, and imaging findings from pediatric patients with suspected appendicitis.

                        Several machine learning models were evaluated, including Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, LightGBM, and CatBoost. 
                        The final model was selected based on its performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC.

                        <strong>This tool should be used for decision support only and not as a replacement for clinical judgment.</strong> 
                        The prediction is based on statistical patterns observed in the training data and should be considered alongside 
                        a thorough clinical examination and the physician's expertise.
