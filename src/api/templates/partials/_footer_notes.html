        <h6>Pediatric Appendicitis Diagnosis Support Tool</h6>
        <p class="small text-muted mb-0">
            This diagnostic support tool uses machine learning to assist pediatricians in assessing the likelihood of appendicitis.
            The model was trained on the Regensburg pediatric appendicitis dataset. The analysis considers demographic information,
            clinical symptoms, and laboratory findings. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) technology is used to provide transparent
            explanations of the machine learning predictions. This tool is intended for clinical decision support only and should not
            replace clinical judgment.
